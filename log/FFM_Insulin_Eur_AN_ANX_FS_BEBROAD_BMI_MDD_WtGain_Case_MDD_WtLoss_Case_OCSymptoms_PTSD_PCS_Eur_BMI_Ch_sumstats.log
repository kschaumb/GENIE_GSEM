Preparing summary statistics for file: data/gwas_sumstats/MDD/MDD_wtgain_clin.gz
Found an NEFF column for sample size. 

Please note that this is likely effective sample size and should only be used for liability h^2 conversion for binary traits and that it should reflect the sum of effective sample sizes across cohorts.

Be aware that some NEFF columns reflect half of the effective sample size; the function will automatically double the column names if recognized [check above in .log file to determine if this is the case].
If the Neff value is halved in the summary stats, but not recognized by the munge function, this should be manually doubled prior to running munge.
