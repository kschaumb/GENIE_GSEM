# Supplementary Figures

## Figure S1. Scree plot of eigenvalues

```{r, fig.cap='*Scree plot of eigenvalues from the LDSC-derived genetic correlation matrix.* Blue points/lines show observed eigenvalues; the red dashed line marks the Kaiser threshold. The elbow occurs around the 3rd component, suggesting diminishing returns after ≈3 factors.', out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("disorder_efa/Scree_plot_eigenvalues_disorders.png")
```

## Figure S2. Parallel analysis

```{r, fig.cap='*Parallel analysis results for the LDSC-derived genetic correlation matrix of the disorders dataset.* Observed eigenvalues (blue) exceeded simulated random eigenvalues (yellow) through approximately the fifth component, although the incremental variance beyond the third factor was minimal.', out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("disorder_efa/Parallel_analysis_plot.png")
```

## Figure S3. Scree plot: Symptoms

```{r, fig.cap='*Scree plot of eigenvalues from the LDSC-derived genetic correlation matrix.* Blue points/lines show observed eigenvalues; the red dashed line marks the Kaiser threshold.', out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("symptoms_efa/Scree_plot_eigenvalues_symptoms.png")
```


## Figure S4. Parallel Analysis 
```{r, fig.cap='*Parallel analysis results for the LDSC-derived genetic correlation matrix of the disorders dataset.* Observed eigenvalues (blue) exceeded simulated random eigenvalues (yellow) through approximately the sixth component, although the incremental variance explained beyond the third factor was minimal.', out.width="85%"}
