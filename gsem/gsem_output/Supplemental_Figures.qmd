# Supplementary Figures

## Figure S1. Scree plot of eigenvalues

```{r, fig.cap='*Scree plot of eigenvalues from the LDSC-derived genetic correlation matrix.* Blue points/lines show observed eigenvalues; the red dashed line marks the Kaiser threshold (λ = 1). The elbow occurs around the 3rd–4th component, suggesting diminishing returns after ≈3 factors.', out.width="85%"}

```

## Figure S2. Parallel analysis

```{r, fig.cap='*Parallel analysis results for the LDSC-derived genetic correlation matrix of the disorders dataset.* Observed eigenvalues (blue) exceeded simulated random eigenvalues (yellow) through approximately the fifth component, although the incremental variance explained beyond the third factor was minimal. The curve shows a clear inflection (“elbow”) after the third factor and asymptotes near zero thereafter, suggesting that a three-factor solution captures the major common variance structure, with additional factors contributing negligible unique information.', out.width="85%"}

## Figure S3. Scree plot: Symptoms

```{r, fig.cap='*Scree plot of eigenvalues from the LDSC-derived genetic correlation matrix.* Blue points/lines show observed eigenvalues; the red dashed line marks the Kaiser threshold (λ = 1).', out.width="85%"}
